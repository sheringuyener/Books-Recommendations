These are the test files for your project 4 code.
1) name the file with your project 4 code project4.py
2) Copy all the files from the zipped directory to the same directory where project4.py resides (as well as books.txt and ratings.txt)
3) Comment out the line in project4 where you call the main function (do not touch the definition of main)
4) Run testCode file. It will tell you whether your code passed or failed the tests
5) Passing the test is 40% of the grade for project 4. If your code fails the test, you need to debug it to see what is incorrect. 6)The test will not work if you changed the recommendation algorithm. 
If you are using a different recommendation algorithm than the one suggested in the handout, you need to discuss it with me prior to submission to make sure if it is at least no worse than the algorithm in the handout. If you submit your code, and I decide that your algorithm is worse than the standard algorithm, you will loose quite a few points.
